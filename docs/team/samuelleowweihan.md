## Project: EzManager
EzManager is a desktop Command Line Interface application used for project management by software engineers.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and allows the user to organise members, track and manage their work.
It is written in Java, and has about XXX kLOC. 

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added Home View feature.
    * What it does: allows the user to have an overview of all the projects and members in the list
    including important information such as deadline, tasks completed per project, roles of members and projects each member is involved in.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user do not have to type in multiple commands
    just to view a list of projects or a list of members.
    * Highlights: This enhancements will affect existing commands to be added in the future
